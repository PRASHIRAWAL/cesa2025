Round 1: Spin the Wheel
Participants get 15 minutes to solve as many coding problems as possible. Each spin decides the problem to attempt. After solving, they must mark it complete before spinning again.

Round 2: Flip the Cards
Top 40% teams qualify. Each team picks a card revealing their coding challenge. After a set time, they may use points to purchase a Power Card, which could be an advantage (bonus points, extra time, hints) or a disadvantage (restrictions, handicaps) based purely on luck.

Rules & Judging:
- Submit complete, functional code for every problem.
- Problems follow predefined I/O specifications.
- Submissions are evaluated against test cases.
- Only correct, properly submitted solutions count toward scoring.
